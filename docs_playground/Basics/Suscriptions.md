## [Personal Data](https://account.codegpt.co/dashboard/personal-data)

In this panel, you have access to the personal data associated with your account. You can edit your name and include a phone number if you wish.

If you want to delete your account, you can use the **Delete Account** option.
- For [Free-trial](https://www.codegpt.co/pricing/#info1-r) accounts, personal data will be removed from our database within a 30-calendar-day interval.
- For [paid](https://www.codegpt.co/pricing/#info1-r) accounts, personal data is deleted, and the payment subscription is canceled for the remaining contracted time. After this period, any data and agents created in the playground will be lost unless the plan is renewed before the canceled plan expires.

## [Subscription](https://account.codegpt.co/dashboard/subscription)

This panel displays your subscriptions and the start date of the contracted plan. If you have a contracted plan, such as Basic, you can manage it through the "Manage Plan" button. In the opened menu on a parallel tab, you can change:
- Payment method
- Billing information

Additionally, you can access your payment history.
