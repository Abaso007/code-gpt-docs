## Chat Settings 

In this option, you can set the features of the provider, change the number of tokens, temperature and window memory.

### Max Token
Tokens can be thought of as pieces of words. Before the API processes the prompts, the input is broken down into tokens.

Each model has a maximum number of tokens. Select the number of tokens depending on the length of the response you want to get and the selected model.

### Temperature
This is a parameter that can be adjusted. It determines the level of randomness or "creativity" in the generated text. A higher temperature will result in more varied and creative output, while a lower temperature will produce output that is more similar to the training data and less likely to contain unexpected or surprising content.

It is a value between 0 and 1. 0 being the most deterministic and 1 being the most random and creative. The default temperature is 0.3

### Window Memory

It stores a list of past conversations, but only the last K (a specific number) conversations are used from the saved list. This is done to prevent the buffer from becoming too large and exceeding the token limit.

- default: 4
- minimum: 1
- maximum: 50
