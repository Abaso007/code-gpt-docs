### PaLM 2 (Pathways Language Model)

PaLM 2 is the next generation of large language models developed by Google. It builds upon Google's legacy of breakthrough research in machine learning and responsible AI.

PaLM 2 excels at advanced reasoning tasks, including code and math, classification and question answering, translation and multilingual proficiency, and natural language generation. It outperforms our previous state-of-the-art LLMs, including PaLM, in these tasks. This is achieved through a combination of compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture enhancements.
