OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization that aims to develop and promote friendly AI in a way that benefits all of humanity. They have developed a number of AI models, including GPT-3, which is one of the most advanced natural language processing models in the world. GPT-3 is able to generate human-like text and perform a variety of language tasks, such as language translation and summarization.

## GPT-3
GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is one of the most advanced natural language processing models developed by OpenAI. It can generate human-like text and perform a wide variety of language-based tasks such as language translation, text completion, and summarization. It's also able to answer questions, generate stories and poetry, and even write code. It has been trained on a large corpus of text data and can understand and respond to a wide range of topics.

## Codex
Codex is an AI model developed by OpenAI that can generate computer programs. It can take a natural language problem statement and generate a working code that solves the problem. It is trained on a diverse set of code and can generate code in multiple programming languages. It's designed to make programming more accessible by allowing developers to express their ideas in natural language, instead of having to write code themselves.
