# Refactor CodeGPT

The Refactor CodeGPT feature empowers you to optimize your codebase effortlessly. You can request CodeGPT to perform intelligent refactoring operations by selecting specific code segments, enhancing code readability and efficiency.

## How to Use:

:::note CodeGPT: Refactor CodeGPT
To use this feature, log in with your CodeGPT account, and you will have limited daily free interactions. You can subscribe to one of our plans to get many more interactions and access the selected AI models without worrying about creating API keys or accounts with each provider (we make it easy for you!). In case you want to use CodeGPT for free, you must add your own API key from the desired provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) and you will pay for the consumption directly to them.

:::

- Select the Code: Highlight the code snippet
- Write the `/` slash, select `/Refactor`, and press `Enter` to send the request.

Experience the power of CodeGPT's intelligent refactoring capabilities. Elevate the quality of your code with ease and precision.
