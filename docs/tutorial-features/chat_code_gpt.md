# CodeGPT Chat

The CodeGPT Chat feature enhances your development experience by allowing you to engage in conversations with a Large Language Models (LLM) directly within your text editor. This tutorial will guide you through the steps to make the most of this powerful tool.

## How to Use:
- Open the Chat Tab
- Navigate to the tools tab and click on `Chat.` By default, `Claude-3.5-Sonnet` will answer on the chat.
- Once the chat tab opens, you can start a conversation by typing a message and hitting `Enter`.
- If you request code, copy or paste it directly into the file with the `Insert code` button.
- You can clean the chat by clicking on `New chat` button or `Reload` the question

### Using Code Selection:
Select the desired code in your editor by level to share code snippets. The selected code will be automatically inserted into the chat interface, allowing CodeGPT to provide more accurate and context-specific responses. Call the function using `@`.

#### Context level

Please enable it, and AI will be able to understand the context of your code. 

You have three levels of context:

- `Selected code`: manually selected code
- `Codebase`: we auto-select the codebase. Please index the codebase before on the `Codebase` button
- `Deep insights`: we enrich the responses with code knowledge graphs.
