# InLine Edit Code

The Inline Code Edit feature of CodeGPT is a powerful tool for editing and refining code directly within your work environment. You must first select CodeGPT as your `Provider` and `Model` to use this feature.

## How to Use:
- Select CodeGPT as `Provider`  and `Model`

To use this feature, log in with your CodeGPT account, and you will have limited daily free interactions. You can subscribe to one of our plans to get many more interactions and access the selected AI models without worrying about creating API keys or accounts with each provider (we make it easy for you!). In case you want to use CodeGPT for free, you must add your own API key from the desired provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) and you will pay for the consumption directly to them.

To learn how to do this, please refer to the following [link](https://help.codegpt.co/en/articles/9939744-connect-codegpt-to-vscode).

:::caution Agents
You also have the option to utilize agents from the Marketplace, as long as you select CodeGPT as your `Provider`.
