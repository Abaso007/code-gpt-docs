# Fix this with CodeGPT

The ***Fix CodeGPT*** feature empowers you to identify and resolve issues in your codebase proactively. By selecting specific code segments, you can prompt CodeGPT to perform a thorough analysis for bugs or potential problems.

## How to Use:
  
:::note CodeGPT: Fix CodeGPT
To use this feature, log in with your CodeGPT account, and you will have limited daily free interactions. You can subscribe to one of our plans to get many more interactions and access the selected AI models without worrying about creating API keys or accounts with each provider (we make it easy for you!). In case you want to use CodeGPT for free, you must add your own API key from the desired provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) and you will pay for the consumption directly to them.
