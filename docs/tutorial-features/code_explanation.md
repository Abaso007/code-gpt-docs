# Explain CodeGPT

The Explain CodeGPT feature empowers you to gain deeper insights into your codebase. You can request CodeGPT to provide detailed explanations and clarifications by selecting specific code segments.

## How to Use:

If you lack API Key access to a provider other than CodeGPT, you can create an account and synchronize it with the extension. To learn how to do this, please refer to the following [link](https://intercom.help/codegpt/en/articles/8699317-connect-with-codegpt-new-extension). Keep in mind that having a CodeGPT account not only grants you access to certain OpenAI models but also provides access to CodeGPT Plus, an advanced generative AI model.
