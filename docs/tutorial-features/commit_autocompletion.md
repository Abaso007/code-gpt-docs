# Commit Autocomplete

This feature automatically completes the changes you've made in your repository whenever you write a commit message. CodeGPT uses the selected model in the Autocomplete settings and retrieves all the files in staging before pushing.

## How to Use:

In your IDE, add the changes to staging and then start writing the commit message. CodeGPT's autocomplete will finish writing the message for you. Once the suggestion appears, press "Tab" to accept it.
