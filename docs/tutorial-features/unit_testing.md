# Unit Test

The Unit Test CodeGPT feature empowers you to quickly generate unit tests for your code. By selecting specific code segments, you can prompt CodeGPT to create a corresponding unit test, enhancing code reliability and quality.

## How to Use:
- Select CodeGPT as `Provider`  and `Model`

If you lack API Key access to a provider other than CodeGPT, you can create an account and synchronize it with the extension. To learn how to do this, please refer to the following [link](https://intercom.help/codegpt/en/articles/8699317-connect-with-codegpt-new-extension). Keep in mind that having a CodeGPT account not only grants you access to certain OpenAI models but also provides access to CodeGPT Plus, an advanced generative AI model.
