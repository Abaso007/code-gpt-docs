# Code Planning

The ***Code Planning*** feature enables expert agents from the CodeGPT marketplace to review your code.

## How to use

:::note CodeGPT: Planning CodeGPT
To use this feature, log in with your CodeGPT account, and you will have limited daily free interactions. You can subscribe to one of our plans to get many more interactions and access the selected AI models without worrying about creating API keys or accounts with each provider (we make it easy for you!). In case you want to use CodeGPT for free, you must add your own API key from the desired provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI) and you will pay for the consumption directly to them.

- Select the Code: Highlight the code snippet
- Write the `/` slash and, select `Planning`, press Enter to send the request
