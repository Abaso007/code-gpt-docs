## Code GPT extension repository
 
- https://github.com/davila7/codegpt

That repository is private for the moment, since the code is being prepared to be published as open source.
I am working very hard to have a good path to receive contributions, it will soon be published on the https://codegpt.co page and in the official communities to start collaborating on the project. I appreciate your patience.

## Code GPT Docs repository
In this repository you will find all the documentation about the extension, Tips for Writing Queries, news about upcoming updates and more.
